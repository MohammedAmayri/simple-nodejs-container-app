# GitHub Deployment Instructions

## Step 1: Push to GitHub

Since you already have a Git repository initialized, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a new repository on GitHub
- Go to https://github.com/new
- Name it something like `simple-nodejs-container-app`
- Make it public (for free GitHub Actions)
- Don't initialize with README (we already have files)

### 2. Add your files and push
```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Simple Node.js container app with Docker and GitHub Actions"

# Add your GitHub repository as origin (replace with your GitHub username/repo)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: GitHub Actions

The GitHub Action is already configured in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and will:

✅ **Automatically run on every push to main branch**
✅ **Test your Node.js app**
✅ **Build Docker image** 
✅ **Test the Docker container**
✅ **Verify everything works**

## Step 3: Deployment Options

After GitHub Actions builds successfully, you can deploy to:

### Option A: Google Cloud Run
```bash
# Build and push to Google Container Registry
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/simple-nodejs-app

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/simple-nodejs-app --platform managed
```

### Option B: Railway
```bash
# Connect your GitHub repo to Railway
# Railway will automatically deploy from your Dockerfile
```

### Option C: Fly.io
```bash
# Install flyctl and run:
fly launch
fly deploy
```

### Option D: Docker Hub + Any Platform
```bash
# Push to Docker Hub
docker tag simple-nodejs-app YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/simple-nodejs-app
docker push YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/simple-nodejs-app
```

## What happens next?

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions will automatically run tests and build
3. You'll see a green checkmark if everything works
4. Deploy to your chosen platform using the Docker image

Your app will be accessible at the provided URL and ready for production use!
