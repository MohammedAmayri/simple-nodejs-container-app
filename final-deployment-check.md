# Final Deployment Check - All Files Verified âœ…

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. âœ… Dockerfile Healthcheck Path Fixed
- **Issue**: Healthcheck used `/usr/src/app/` but workdir is `/app`
- **Fixed**: Changed to `/app/healthcheck.js`

### 2. âœ… Docker Compose Service Order Fixed  
- **Issue**: Caddy had `depends_on: nodejs-app` which could cause startup issues

## Deployment Ready! ðŸš€

All configuration files are now correct. The issue with your domain showing the Flask app instead of Node.js is simply that the Docker Compose stack needs to be started.

**Next Step**: Push these fixes to GitHub to trigger automatic deployment, or manually run the Docker Compose commands on your droplet.
