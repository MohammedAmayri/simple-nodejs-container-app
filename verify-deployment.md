# How to Verify Your Deployment Status

## Check Current Status on Your Droplet

SSH into your droplet and run these commands to verify what's currently deployed:

### 1. Check Running Containers
```bash
docker ps
```
**Expected output:**
- Should show `simple-nodejs-app` container running
- Should show `caddy-proxy` container running (after full deployment)

### 2. Check Available Images
```bash
docker images
```
**Expected output:**
- `simple-nodejs-app:latest` (your Node.js app)
- `caddy:2-alpine` (if Docker Compose deployed)

### 3. Check if Docker Compose is Installed
```bash
docker-compose --version
```
**Expected output:** Version number if installed

### 4. Check Application Directory Structure
```bash
ls -la /home/deployer/app/
```
**Expected output after full deployment:**
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `Caddyfile`

### 5. Test Your Applications

#### Current Node.js App (port 3000):
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000
```

#### Test Domain Resolution:
```bash
curl -I http://lkdevcontaineronline.online
curl -I https://lkdevcontaineronline.online
```

#### Your Flask App (should still work):
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080
```

### 6. Check Network Ports in Use
```bash
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep -E ':80|:443|:3000|:8080'
```
**Expected after full deployment:**
- Port 80: Caddy HTTP
- Port 443: Caddy HTTPS  
- Port 3000: Node.js app (internal)
- Port 8080: Your Flask app

### 7. Check SSL Certificate Status (after deployment)
```bash
# This will work after Caddy gets SSL certificate
curl -I https://lkdevcontaineronline.online
```

## Current vs. Expected State

### What You Have Now:
- ✅ Node.js container running on port 3000
- ✅ Flask container running on port 8080
- ✅ Direct access via IP:3000

### What You'll Have After GitHub Push:
- ✅ Caddy proxy running on ports 80/443
- ✅ Node.js app accessible via https://lkdevcontaineronline.online
- ✅ Automatic SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
- ✅ Security headers and compression
- ✅ Flask app still accessible on port 8080

## Verification Checklist

Run these commands to check deployment status:

```bash
# 1. Check what's currently running
echo "=== Current Containers ==="
docker ps

# 2. Check available images  
echo "=== Available Images ==="
docker images

# 3. Check if app directory exists
echo "=== App Directory ==="
ls -la /home/deployer/app/ 2>/dev/null || echo "App directory not created yet"

# 4. Check network ports
echo "=== Network Ports ==="
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep -E ':80|:443|:3000|:8080'

# 5. Test current access
echo "=== Testing Current Access ==="
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Node.js app (port 3000): %{http_code}\n" http://localhost:3000
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Flask app (port 8080): %{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8080

# 6. Test domain (will work after deployment)
echo "=== Testing Domain ==="
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Domain HTTP: %{http_code}\n" http://lkdevcontaineronline.online 2>/dev/null || echo "Domain HTTP: Not accessible yet"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Domain HTTPS: %{http_code}\n" https://lkdevcontaineronline.online 2>/dev/null || echo "Domain HTTPS: Not accessible yet"
```

## Expected Changes After GitHub Push

1. **Docker Compose stack will be deployed**
2. **Caddy will obtain SSL certificate** 
3. **Your domain will have HTTPS access**
4. **Node.js app will be behind Caddy proxy**
5. **Flask app continues running unchanged**
