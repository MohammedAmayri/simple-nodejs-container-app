# Fix Domain Routing Issue

## Problem
The domain `lkdevcontaineronline.online` is showing the Flask app instead of the Node.js app.

## Root Cause
Caddy isn't running yet, so the domain is being served by something else (likely nginx, apache, or the Flask app directly on port 80).

## Solution Steps

### 1. Check What's Running on Port 80
```bash
# Check what's using port 80
sudo ss -tlnp | grep :80
# or
sudo lsof -i :80
```

### 2. Check if Caddy is Actually Running
```bash
# Check if caddy container exists
docker ps | grep caddy

# Check docker-compose status
cd /home/deployer/app
docker-compose ps
```

### 3. Start the Docker Compose Stack
```bash
cd /home/deployer/app
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Verify Caddy is Running
```bash
# Check containers
docker ps

# Check logs
docker-compose logs caddy
```

### 5. If Port 80 is Blocked by Another Service
```bash
# Stop nginx if running
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl disable nginx

# Stop apache if running
sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl disable apache2

# Then restart docker-compose
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

## Expected Result
- Caddy container running on ports 80/443
- Node.js app accessible via domain
- Flask app accessible only via IP:8080
